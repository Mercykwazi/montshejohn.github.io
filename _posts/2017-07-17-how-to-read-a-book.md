### how to read a book 

So I just read this article on how to read a book by Mortimer Adler.
i never thought that there are ways on how to read i just thought reading was 
Just reading.

Now today i learned that there are four levels / methods of reading a book
those four methods are :1.elementary 
                        2. inspection 
                        3. Analytical 
                        4. synoptical 
with this above mentioned levels reading becomes more interesting more entertaining and of course
knowledgeable. i have reason to believe that there is a whole lot of information in this world 
that we aren't aware of and of that info 80% the information is written down in books.it can be any book
it can be the Guinness world records book it can be the rich dad poor dad book
